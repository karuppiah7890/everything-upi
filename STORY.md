So, I recently had this idea of building an Open Source UPI App like PhonePe, Google Pay. So, this is me checking out everything about UPI and trying to build something with it! :)

Some links I was checking out -

https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/upi-autopay

https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/live-members

https://www.npci.org.in/what-we-do/upi/3rd-party-apps

https://www.upichalega.com/

I need to read more, I was just skimming through some of the above stuff

Today I went to
https://www.npci.org.in/

And found a link for "developer" - https://infinit.co.in/

I have registered myself on the website. I'm going to checkout what kind of APIs
they provide! :)

https://infinit.co.in/DeveloperProgramAgreement

I'm not getting the registration email from the platform though. Hmm
